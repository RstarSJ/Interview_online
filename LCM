LCM is the immediate largest number which is divisible by both the numbers.

a=int(input("Enter number 1 :"))
b=int(input("Enter number 2 :"))

if a < b:
    large=b
else:
    large=a

lcm=1

while(1):
    if large%a==0 and large%b==0:
        lcm=large
        break
    large=large+1

print("LCM of",a,"and",b,"is",lcm)
